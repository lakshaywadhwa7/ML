## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
mydata = read.table("WCST.txt")
n = nrow(mydata)
xbar = mean(mydata$score)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=mydata) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes( x = score), bins = 50)

#Based on the below histogram plot, the data is right skewed  and does not look normal. 
#We need to use log in order to possibly make it look normally distributed.

ggplot(data=mydata) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes( x = log(score)), bins = 50)

shapiro.test(mydata$score)

#Shapiro.test is a test for normality. The null hypothesis for this test is a data that comes from a normal distribution. 
#The alternative hypothesis is if we can gather any evidence that suggests that the data come from some other distribution.
#This test shows if the data is normal and can be used in conjunction with the histogram for comparison. 
#We do this together to see if we have a normal distribution. 
#Since the p-value is small, we reject the null hypothesis that data comes from a normal distribution.

```
B.3 a)
```{r}
data<-read.table("WCST.txt")
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
#Shapiro.test is a test for normality. The null hypothesis for this test is a data that comes from a normal distribution. 
#The alternative hypothesis is if we can gather any evidence that suggests that the data come from some other distribution.

shapiro.test(data$score)


```
#Since,the p value is very very less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.


b)What assumptions must be made in order to compute a (non-boostrap) 95% confidence interval for the population mean score?

The only assumption should be that the all sample ints are iid and sample should be picked randomly.

c)Compute the confidence interval from (b).

```{r}
mean_data<-mean(data$score)
sd_data<-sd(data$score)
lb<-mean_data-1.96*(sd_data)/sqrt(nrow(data))
ub<-mean_data+1.96*(sd_data)/sqrt(nrow(data))
paste("lower_bound",lb)

paste("upper_bound",ub)
```


d) Compute a 95% percentile bootstrap pivot confidence interval for the mean.

```{r}
B=300
bs=replicate(B,sample(data$score,nrow(data),replace=TRUE));
dim(bs)
theta_star<-colMeans(bs)
lb<-quantile(theta_star,0.025)
ub<-quantile(theta_star,0.975)
ub_pivot<-2*mean_data-lb
paste("upper_bound_pivot",ub_pivot)
lb_pivot<-2*mean_data-ub
paste("lower_bound_pivot",lb_pivot)
```
